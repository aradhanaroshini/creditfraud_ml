CREDIT CARD FRAUD PREDICTION
Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of your credit card or its details to make purchases or get funds, often involving identity theft through methods like phishing, skimming, or data breaches, leading to financial loss and damaged credit, but it can be prevented by monitoring accounts, using strong passwords, and being wary of scams. Fraudsters steal card numbers, PINs, or CVV codes to create cloned cards, make online purchases (Card-Not-Present fraud), or even open new accounts in your name.  
To prevent this I have created a ml model that analyzes your input data and hence giving whether your account is safe or not.
I have used the following model:
1.SVM
2.Random forest classifier
3.Logistic Regression
For the final detection: Logistic regression
